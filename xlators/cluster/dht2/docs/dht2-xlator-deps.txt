DHT2 Translator Dependencies
----------------------------

This document captures various dependencies of translators (+daemons) in
GlusterFS that rely of DHTs behaviour directly or indirectly. With the
introduction of MDS and DS split alongside directories spread across
MDSs, components that depend on old DHT behaviour would need to accomodate
with DHT2.

NOTE: Points captured in this document are one lines and not explained in
      deatil: that would be done over time. In case of any confusing please
      drop a mail to gluster-devel@gluster.org for any clarification or
      explanation regarding the dependencies mentioned in this document.

Geo-replication
  - Two (or three) step replication
    * entry
    * data
    * metadata
  - Gsyncd on *all* node (DS + MDS)
    * DS synchronization needs to "wait" for entry synchonization
    * singleton stime on root
    * Due to directories spread among all MDS's, there might be
      ordering requirements b/w gsyncd running on MDS's
        - Might have a different approach where we create a dangling
          inode and later let the entry catch up
        - rmdir() operations are auto-ordered: since there is less
          relation b/w parent and child at the MDS
        - Data synchronization can proceed even if the corresponding
          entry was not synchronized if inode is synchronized first
          (later the entry "attaches" with the inode and completes the
          namespace).
