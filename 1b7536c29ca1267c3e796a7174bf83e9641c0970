But to implement calls like fstat() where the information needs to be fetched from the MDS (post phase I).\n\nFurthermore, it would be good to churn out open() call and the relevant structures that are maintained in DS/MDS.\n\n[\n    There is some mention about open{dir} in the initial DHT2    \n    prototype design, I\u0027ll probably read that again.\n]",
